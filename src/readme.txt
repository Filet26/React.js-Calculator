This is a simple React calculator that can multiply, divide, add and subtract numbers.

how to use:

simple press any numbers you want to computer along with operators, eg. 5 + 7.

next, press the '=' button to compute the numbers, your result will be displayed on the screen.

you can clear all items on the display by pressing the 'Clear' button on the botton of the calculator.

this calculator uses props and state to render all the numbers. I used eval() to evaluate the input, since this is only for private use it is fine,
but the eval() method has had a history of being exploitable.
